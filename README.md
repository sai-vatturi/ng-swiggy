I have included all the features and followed implementation details that was mentioned in the requirement document here: [Mini Project_ Swiggy Clone Using Angular.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17674299/Mini.Project_.Swiggy.Clone.Using.Angular.1.pdf)

Run `npm install` to install the required packages. 
Run `ng serve` to start the live server.

## Project Highlights

- **Custom Dataset**:
  - A unique dataset simulating real-world restaurant information, menu items, user reviews, and more.
  - Includes location-based filtering, allowing users to view restaurants and menu items specific to their selected location.
  - Custom Dataset link: [data.json](https://github.com/sai-vatturi/ng-swiggy/blob/main/src/assets/data/data.json)

- **Dynamic Image Integration**:
  - Utilizes images from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) to simulate a variety of food and restaurant images, creating a realistic visual experience.

- **Authentication**:
  - Integrated with MockAPI for user login and registration.
  - Saved login credentials and order details stored in MockAPI at:
    - **Users**: [https://6728d0196d5fa4901b6b0a9c.mockapi.io/api/users](https://6728d0196d5fa4901b6b0a9c.mockapi.io/api/users)
    - **Orders**: [https://6728d0196d5fa4901b6b0a9c.mockapi.io/api/orders](https://6728d0196d5fa4901b6b0a9c.mockapi.io/api/orders)

- **Order Selection Page**:
  - Added an **Order Selection** page that enables users to:

    - **Order by Restaurant**: Explore available restaurants for direct ordering.
  
- **Homepage**:
  - Displays featured restaurants and popular cuisines using the custom dataset.
